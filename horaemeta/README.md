HoraeMeta is the meta service for managing the Apache HoraeDB (incubating) cluster.

## Status
The project is in a very early stage.

## Quick Start
### Build HoraeMeta binary
```bash
make build
```

### Standalone Mode
Although HoraeMeta is designed to deployed as a cluster with three or more instances, it can also be started standalone:
```bash
# HoraeMeta0
mkdir /tmp/meta0
./bin/horaemeta-server --config ./config/example-standalone.toml
```

### Cluster mode
Here is an example for starting HoraeMeta in cluster mode (three instances) on single machine by using different ports:
```bash
# Create directories.
mkdir /tmp/meta0
mkdir /tmp/meta1
mkdir /tmp/meta2

# horaemeta0
./bin/horaemeta-server --config ./config/exampl-cluster0.toml

# horaemeta1
./bin/horaemeta-server --config ./config/exampl-cluster1.toml

# horaemeta2
./bin/horaemeta-server --config ./config/exampl-cluster2.toml
```

## Acknowledgment
